I was going to make a guess at determining the actual wire guage but I'm no expert in that. I can say that the chassis ground wires are slightly thicker than the other ones, which appear to be standard Atari arcade wiring size.

I'm attaching the original Atari wiring diagram along with mine. Mine of course have the wire lengths and the connector part numbers. See above for a link to the connectors and pins. I'll also include a link to my github repository with the source files for the diagram.

NOTE1: I did not manually add the diode to the right coin counter harness. On my harness, the diode is broken in half and I can't read a value. You can see the correct orientation in the Atari diagram. There are rubber sleeves over the diode legs to help prevent a short.

NOTE2: The lengths provided are for the exposed wire lengths. The actual lengths are a bit longer as they are crimped and inserted into the connectors. Also, exact measurements were nearly impossible, so these are close but not perfect.

NOTE3: To recreate my wiring diagram, WireViz is needed: https://github.com/formatc1702/WireViz
