Atari Utility Panel Designs 1.1.zip
===================================

Except for the two panels with no revision listed, these designs were created by taking direct measurements of actual utility panels. The panels all measure around 0.047in in thickness including the black paint, so I presume these are all 18 gauge steel.

These designs were exported by Fusion 360 2.0.15050.  I have exported these with unreferenced linked parameters in order to allow others to link them correctly after importing.  As far as I know, I'm using an undocumented behavior for this, so future versions may not allow this linking to be done. If that happens I'll try to post an updated version.  The linking process is fully documented in the included video as well as an example showing how to alter one of the values and cause the design to update.

Also included are 2D DXF files which can be used to have these panels fabricated. The file name includes not only the part number of the panel, but also the bend angle to be used.  As far as I can tell, the early utility panels with the rear mounted test switches had a bend of 45 degrees, while the later panels with the front mounted test switches are all 60 degrees.  For my test, I uploaded the DXF to sendcutsend.com, provided the bend angle, and they were able to send me a completed panel quickly.

Although these panels were originally created by Atari, I do not know who currently owns the IP. These Fusion 360 files were created by Jon Raiford and are provided under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) license.
